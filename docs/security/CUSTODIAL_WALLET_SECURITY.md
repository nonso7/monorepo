# Custodial Wallet Security Architecture

## 1. Overview

This document defines the **threat model, security controls, and incident response procedures** for the custodial wallet system.

The wallet consists of:

* Backend signing service
* KMS-managed master keys
* Encrypted key database
* Redis session store
* Soroban smart contracts (Rust)
* Stellar account-level signers

This document is operational and actionable.

# 2. System Architecture (High-Level)

```
User → API → Signing Service → KMS → Stellar Network
                  ↓
                Database (Encrypted Keys)
                  ↓
               Audit Logs
```

Critical trust boundaries:

1. API Layer
2. Signing Service
3. Database
4. Key Management System (KMS)
5. Smart Contract (Pause Switch)

---

# 3. Threat Model

## 3.1 Database Leak

### Scenario

Attacker gains read access to the production database.

### Risk

* Exposure of encrypted private keys
* Exposure of user metadata
* Replay attempts

### Mitigations

* Envelope encryption (DEK + KEK model)
* No plaintext keys stored
* No secrets stored in logs
* Strict DB network isolation
* Row-level access policies

---

## 3.2 Server Compromise

### Scenario

Attacker gains shell access to signing server.

### Risk

* Memory scraping
* Unauthorized transaction signing
* KMS misuse

### Mitigations

* Signing controlled via `SIGNING_ENABLED` flag
* KMS IAM role restriction
* mTLS between services
* No local master key storage
* Short-lived JWT sessions
* Memory zeroization (`zeroize` crate)

---

## 3.3 Insider Risk

### Scenario

Authorized engineer misuses access.

### Risk

* Direct signing
* Key extraction attempts
* Log tampering

### Mitigations

* RBAC (no shared admin accounts)
* Mandatory MFA
* KMS access scoped to service account only
* Audit logs immutable (WORM bucket)
* Dual control for key rotation

---

## 3.4 Log Leakage

### Scenario

Sensitive data accidentally logged.

### Risk

* JWT tokens exposed
* Key fragments leaked
* Transaction preimages leaked

### Mitigations

* Structured logging with redaction
* No request body logging
* Log retention < 30 days
* Secret scanning in CI

---

## 3.5 Replay Attacks

### Scenario

Valid signed transaction replayed.

### Mitigations

* Network passphrase validation
* Soroban `require_auth`
* Sequence number enforcement
* TTL expiration monitoring

---

# 4. Security Controls

---

## 4.1 Encryption at Rest (Envelope Model)

Architecture:

```
User Key → Encrypted with DEK
DEK → Encrypted with KMS KEK
```

### Controls

* Master Key (KEK) stored in AWS/GCP KMS
* DEKs generated per wallet
* AES-256-GCM encryption
* DEKs never stored plaintext
* All key structs implement `Zeroize`

### Required Env Vars

| Variable                     | Purpose          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `KMS_KEY_ID`                 | ID of master key |
| `ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM`       | AES-256-GCM      |
| `KEY_ROTATION_INTERVAL_DAYS` | e.g. 90          |

---

## 4.2 Access Controls

* IAM role attached to signing service
* No static cloud credentials
* Admin functions require on-chain `require_auth`
* Production access via bastion host only
* Database access restricted to VPC

---

## 4.3 Audit Logging

### On-Chain

* Every transfer emits event
* Indexed by backend watcher

### Off-Chain

Audit logs must include:

* Timestamp
* User ID
* Wallet ID
* Tx Hash
* IP Address
* Request ID

Logs stored in:

* Immutable storage bucket
* Retention: 1 year minimum

---

## 4.4 Key Rotation

### Automatic Rotation

* DEK rotation: every 90 days
* KEK rotation: annually via KMS

### Manual Rotation Procedure

1. Generate new DEK
2. Re-encrypt private key
3. Update DB record
4. Verify decrypt works
5. Securely delete old DEK

---

## 4.5 Signing Pause Switch

Two-level protection:

### 1. Backend Flag

```
SIGNING_ENABLED=false
```

Blocks all new signing requests.

### 2. On-Chain Pause

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source-account <ADMIN_SECRET> \
  --network <network> \
  -- pause
```

Both must be activated during major incident.

# 5. Incident Response Runbooks

---

# 5.1 Incident: Suspected DB Leak

### Immediate Actions

1. Set `SIGNING_ENABLED=false`
2. Rotate KMS KEK
3. Force DEK re-encryption batch job
4. Invalidate all sessions
5. Enable enhanced logging

### Follow-up

* Run audit trail comparison of last 30 days
* Notify affected users within 24 hours
* Publish incident report within 72 hours

---

# 5.2 Incident: Signing Server Compromised

### Immediate Actions

1. Pause signing (backend)
2. Invoke on-chain `pause`
3. Rotate IAM credentials
4. Redeploy clean infrastructure from IaC
5. Rotate Stellar account signers

### Verification

* Compare signed tx hashes vs expected DB intents
* Confirm no unauthorized transfers

---

5. Invalidate all JWT sessions
6. Require user password reset

---
